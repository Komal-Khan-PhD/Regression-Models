    "# Least Squares Method\n",
    "## Abstract:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a narrow sense, the Least Squares Method is a technique for fitting a straight line through a set of points in such a way that the sum of the squared vertical distances from the observed points to the fitted line is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a wider sense, the Least Squares Method is a general approach to fitting a model of the data-generating mechanism to the observed data. The model is specified by an equation with free parameters. The values of the model parameters are being chosen to minimize the sum of the squared deviations of the data from the values predicted by the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Least Squares Method is widely used in building estimators and in regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is the Least Squares Method?\n",
    "The least-squares method is a form of mathematical regression analysis used to determine the line of best fit for a set of data, providing a visual demonstration of the relationship between the data points. Each point of data represents the relationship between a known independent variable and an unknown dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Least Squares Method\n",
    "This method of regression analysis begins with a set of data points to be plotted on an x- and y-axis graph. An analyst using the least-squares method will generate a line of best fit that explains the potential relationship between independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/images/least-squares-example.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The least-squares method provides the overall rationale for the placement of the line of best fit among the data points being studied. The most common application of this method, which is sometimes referred to as \"linear\" or \"ordinary,\" aims to create a straight line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors that are generated by the results of the associated equations, such as the squared residuals resulting from differences in the observed value, and the value anticipated, based on that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Line of Best Fit Equation\n",
    "The line of best fit determined from the least squares method has an equation that tells the story of the relationship between the data points. Line of best-fit equations may be determined by computer software models, which include a summary of outputs for analysis, where the coefficients and summary outputs explain the dependence of the variables being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equation of a line:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = mx + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "y = how far up \\\n",
    "x = how far along \\\n",
    "m = Slope or Gradient (how steep the line is) \\\n",
    "b = the Y Intercept (where the line crosses the Y axis) \n",
    "\n",
    "$ m = \\frac{(N Σ(xy) − Σx Σy)}{(N Σ(x^2) − (Σx)^2)} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "$ b =  \\frac{(Σy − m Σx)}{N} $ (Σ means \"sum up\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the least-squares method is an analyst who wishes to test the relationship between a company’s stock returns, and the returns of the index for which the stock is a component. In this example, the analyst seeks to test the dependence of the stock returns on the index returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, all of the returns are plotted on a chart. The index returns are then designated as the independent variable, and the stock returns are the dependent variable. The line of best fit provides the analyst with coefficients explaining the level of dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outliers\n",
    "Be careful! Least squares is sensitive to outliers. A strange value will pull the line towards it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Not Just For Lines\n",
    "This idea can be used in many other areas, not just lines.\n",
    "\n"
