## 🚀 **Why Regression Matters**  
Regression isn’t just about fitting lines to data. It’s about:  
- **Uncovering hidden patterns** in noisy datasets.  
- **Quantifying relationships** between variables (e.g., "How does square footage affect home prices?").  
- **Building a foundation** for advanced techniques like regularization and neural networks.
